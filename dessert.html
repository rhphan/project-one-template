					<h2 class="dessert">Xôi</h2>
					<p>Xôi is a sweet (ngọt) or savory (mặn) Vietnamese dish made
						from glutinous rice and other ingredients. Although it is often
						served as a dessert, in many mountainous areas in Vietnam, like
						the Central Highlands and Hoàng Liên Sơn mountains in northern
						Vietnam, people eat xôi as a main dish. Xôi is a common on-thego
						breakfast item, and a popular snack nationwide.

					<h2 class="dessert">Bánh Bò</h2>
					<p>Bánh bò is a sweet, chewy sponge cake from Vietnam. It is made
						from rice flour, water, sugar, and yeast, and has a honeycomblike
						appearance on the inside due to the presence of numerous
						small air bubbles. Coconut milk is also usually a part of the batter,
						imparting a slight flavor and aroma of coconut. The cake is of
						Southern Chinese origin, although the Chinese version, called bái
						táng gāo, does not contain coconut milk. Bánh bò are generally
						eaten as a dessert, although they may also be consumed as an
						accompaniment to a meal.
