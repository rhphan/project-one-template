					<p>Gỏi cuốn, Vietnamese spring roll, fresh spring roll or cold roll,
						is a Vietnamese dish traditionally consisting of pork, prawn,
						vegetables, bún (rice vermicelli), and other ingredients wrapped
						in Vietnamese bánh tráng (commonly known as rice paper or
						cold roll). Like other spring roll dishes, they are believed to have
						an origin in China and were introduced to Vietnam by Chinese
						immigrants although the gỏi cuốn has been modified to suit local
						tastes.
