					<h2 class="noodles">Mì Quảng</h2>
					<p>Mì Quảng, is a Vietnamese noodle dish that originated from Quảng
						Nam Province in central Vietnam. In the region, it is one of the
						most popular and nationally recognized food items.
						<br>
						The main ingredients are rice noodles, meat, and herbs, most
						commonly served with a small amount of broth, which is generally
						infused with turmeric. Wide rice noodles are placed atop of a
						bed of fresh herbs in a bowl (or vice versa), and then warm or
						lukewarm broth and meat are added. The broth is usually strongly
						flavored and only a small amount of it is used, generally enough
						to partially cover the vegetables.

					<h2 class="noodles">Bún Bò</h2>
					<p>Bún bò originated in Huế, a former capital of Vietnam. Outside
						the city of Huế and some parts of central Vietnam, it is called bún
						bò Huế to denote its origin. Within Huế and surrounding cities, it
						is known simply as bún bò. The broth is prepared by simmering
						beef bones and beef shank with lemongrass, and then seasoned
						with fermented shrimp sauce and sugar for taste. Spicy chili oil is
						added later during the cooking process.
						<br>
						Bún bò usually includes thin slices of marinated and boiled beef
						shank, chunks of oxtail, and pig’s knuckles. It can also include
						cubes of congealed pig blood, which has a color between dark
						brown and maroon, and a texture resembling firm tofu.
